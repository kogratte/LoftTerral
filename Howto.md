# Work tracking

## Step 1: The boilerplate!

Because there is almost no interest in setup a project, I take the time to work on something reusable, formerly, a boilerplate wich use I want to be able to use in my favorite stack.

I choose to combine the best parts I learned during my previous positions:
- VueJS
- Typescript
- Jest
- Cucumber
- Cypress

This boilerplate also include a DockerFile & a dockercompose, to simplify build & tests from scratch.

## Step 2: Front... Whaaat?

Install all packages, and add vuetify to be able to use well tested components.
